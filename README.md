## Heroes Data

# Goal
This is a collection of tools to import Heroes of the Storm data from some third party sources.
The importer reads JSON files from https://github.com/heroespatchnotes/heroes-talents and imports them
into a Postgres database. The tier updater reads the tier list from http://www.robogrub.com/tierlist using the same API.
